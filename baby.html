            Consider getting help during this time, which can be very hectic and
            overwhelming. While in the hospital, talk to the experts around you.
            Many hospitals have feeding specialists or lactation consultants who
            can help you get started

              >nursing or bottle-feeding</a
            >. Nurses also are a great resource to show you how to hold, burp,
            change, and care for your baby.
          </p>
          <p>
            For in-home help, you might want to hire a baby nurse, postpartum
            doula, or a responsible neighborhood teen to help you for a short
            time after the birth. Your doctor or the hospital can help you find
            information about in-home help, and might make a referral to home
            health agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relatives and friends often want to help too. Even if you disagree
            on certain things, don't dismiss their experience. But if you don't
            feel up to having guests or you have other concerns, don't feel
            guilty about placing restrictions on visitors.

          <p>
            If you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, their fragility
            may be intimidating. Here are a few basics to remember:

              yet, so they're at risk for infection. Make sure that everyone who
              handles your baby has clean hands.

              <b class="emphasis">Support your baby's head and neck.</b> Cradle

            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/bonding.html">Bonding</a
            >, probably one of the most pleasurable parts of infant care,
            happens during the sensitive time in the first hours and days after
            birth when parents make a deep connection with their infant.
            Physical closeness can promote an emotional connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional growth,
            which also affects their development in other areas, such as
            physical growth. Another way to think of bonding is "falling in
            love" with your baby. Children thrive from having a parent or other
            adult in their life who loves them unconditionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or her
            in different patterns. Both you and your partner can also take the
            opportunity to be "skin-to-skin," holding your newborn against your
            own skin while feeding or cradling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical problems,
            may respond to infant massage. Certain types of massage may enhance
            bonding and help with infant growth and development. Many books and
            videos cover infant massage — ask your doctor for recommendations.
            Be careful, however — babies are not as strong as adults, so massage
            your baby gently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling,
            singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably also love listening to
            music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to
            stimulate your infant's hearing. If your little one is being fussy,
            try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/reading-babies.html">
              reading
            </a>
            aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or sound,
            and might startle and cry easily, sleep less than expected, or turn
            their faces away when someone speaks or sings to them. If that's the
            case with your baby, keep noise and light levels low to moderate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="emphasis">Swaddling</b>, which works well for some babies
            during their first few weeks, is another soothing technique
            first-time parents should learn. Proper swaddling keeps a baby's
            arms close to the body while allowing for some movement of the legs.
            Not only does swaddling keep a baby warm, but it seems to give most
            newborns a sense of security and comfort. Swaddling also may help
            limit the startle reflex, which can wake a baby.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how to swaddle a baby:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded over
              slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head above the
              folded corner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap the left corner over the body and tuck it beneath the back of
              the baby, going under the right arm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring the bottom corner up over the baby's feet and pull it toward
              the head, folding the fabric down if it gets close to the face. Be
              sure not to wrap too tightly around the hips. Hips and knees
              should be slightly bent and turned out. Wrapping your baby too
              tightly may increase the chance of
              <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/ddh.html">
                hip dysplasia</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the
              baby's back on the left side, leaving only the neck and head
              exposed. To make sure your baby is not wrapped too tight, make
              sure you can slip a hand between the blanket and your baby's
              chest, which will allow comfortable breathing. Make sure, however,
              that the blanket is not so loose that it could become undone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Babies should not be swaddled after they're 2 months old. At this
              age, some babies can roll over while swaddled, which increases
              their risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

          <p>
            You'll probably decide before you bring your baby home whether
            you'll use cloth or disposable diapers. Whichever you use, your
            little one will dirty diapers about 10 times a day, or about 70
            times a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before

            >
            , make sure you have all supplies within reach so you won't have to
            leave your infant unattended on the changing table. You'll need:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a clean diaper</li>
            <li>fasteners (if cloth prefold diapers are used)</li>
            <li>diaper ointment</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                diaper wipes (or a container of warm water and a clean washcloth
                or cotton balls) After each bowel movement or if the diaper is
                wet, lay your baby on his or her back and remove the dirty
                diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the wipes
                to gently wipe your baby's genital area clean. When removing a
                boy's diaper, do so carefully because exposure to the air may
                make him urinate. When wiping a girl, wipe her bottom from front
                to back to avoid a

                  >urinary tract infection (UTI)</a
                >
                . To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember to
                wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper.

                  >Diaper rash</a
                >
                is a common concern. Typically the rash is red and bumpy and
                will go away in a few days with warm baths, some diaper cream,
                and a little time out of the diaper. Most rashes happen because
                the baby's skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wet or
                poopy diaper.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>To prevent or heal diaper rash, try these tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Change your baby's diaper often, and as soon as possible after
              bowel movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gently clean the area with mild soap and water (wipes sometimes
              can be irritating), then apply a very thick layer of diaper rash
              or "barrier" cream. Creams with zinc oxide are preferred because
              they form a barrier against moisture.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free
              detergents.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the
              skin a chance to air out.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be
            getting worse, call your doctor — it may be caused by a fungal
            infection that requires a prescription.

          <ul>
            <li>
              the umbilical cord falls off and the navel heals completely (1–4

          <p>
            A bath two or three times a week in the first year is fine. More
            frequent bathing may be drying to the skin.
          </p>
          <p>Have these items ready before bathing your baby:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a soft, clean washcloth</li>
            <li>mild, unscented baby soap and shampoo</li>
            <li>a soft brush to stimulate the baby's scalp</li>

            <li>a clean diaper</li>
            <li>clean clothes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b class="emphasis">Sponge baths.</b> For a sponge bath, select a
            safe, flat surface (such as a changing table, floor, or counter) in
            a warm room. Fill a sink, if nearby, or bowl with warm (not hot!)
            water. Undress your baby and wrap him or her in a towel. Wipe your
            infant's eyes with a washcloth (or a clean cotton ball) dampened
            with water only, starting with one eye and wiping from the inner
            corner to the outer corner. Use a clean corner of the washcloth or
            another cotton ball to wash the other eye. Clean your baby's nose
            and ears with the damp washcloth. Then wet the cloth again and,
            using a little soap, wash his or her face gently and pat it dry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, using baby shampoo, create a lather and gently wash your
            baby's head and rinse. Using a wet cloth and soap, gently wash the
            rest of the baby, paying special attention to creases under the
            arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and in the genital area.
            Once you have washed those areas, make sure they are dry and then
            diaper and dress your baby.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b class="emphasis">Tub baths.</b> When your baby is ready for tub
            baths, the first baths should be gentle and brief. If he or she
            becomes upset, go back to sponge baths for a week or two, then try
            the bath again.
          </p>
          <p>In addition to the supplies listed above, add:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              an infant tub with 2 to 3 inches of warm — not hot! — water (to
              test the water temperature, feel the water with the inside of your
              elbow or wrist). An infant tub is a plastic tub that can fit in
              the bathtub; it's a better size for babies and makes bathing
              easier to manage.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Undress your baby and then place him or her in the water
            immediately, in a warm room, to prevent chills. Make sure the water
            in the tub is no more than 2 to 3 inches deep, and that the water is
            no longer running in the tub. Use one of your hands to support the
            head and the other hand to guide the baby in feet-first. Speaking
            gently, slowly lower your baby up to the chest into the tub.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair. Gently massage
            your baby's scalp with the pads of your fingers or a soft baby
            hairbrush, including the area over the fontanelles (soft spots) on
            the top of the head. When you rinse the soap or shampoo from your

            Throughout the bath, regularly pour water gently over your baby's
            body so he or she doesn't get cold. After the bath, wrap your baby
            in a towel immediately, making sure to cover his or her head. Baby
            towels with hoods are great for keeping a freshly washed baby warm.

            petroleum jelly to keep the wound from sticking to the diaper.
            Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after a diaper change,
            then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn't stick to the
            diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few
            days, but if the redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled
            blisters form, infection may be present and you should call your
            baby's doctor immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors
            suggest swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump
            dries up and falls off, usually in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others
            recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child's doctor to see
            what he or she prefers.

          <p>
            An infant's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water until the
            cord stump falls off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the
            cord stump will change color from yellow to brown or black — this is
            normal. Call your doctor if the navel area looks red or if a foul
            odor or discharge develops.

          <p>Feeding and Burping Your Baby</p>
        </div>

            Whether feeding your newborn by
            <a

            >
              breast or a bottle</a
            >, you may be stumped as to how often to do so. Generally, it's
            recommended that babies be fed on demand — whenever they seem
            hungry. Your baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in his or
            her mouth, or making sucking noises.
          </p>
          <p>
            A newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours. If you're
            breastfeeding, give your baby the chance to nurse about 10–15
            minutes at each breast. If you're formula-feeding, your baby will
            most likely take about 2–3 ounces (60–90 milliliters) at each
            feeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some newborns may need to be awakened every few hours to make sure
            they get enough to eat. Call your baby's doctor if you need to wake
            your newborn often or if your baby doesn't seem interested in eating
            or sucking.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby is
            getting enough to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can be a
            little trickier. If your baby seems satisfied, produces about six
            wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well, and is gaining
            weight regularly, then he or she is probably eating enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another good way to tell if your baby is getting milk is to notice
            if your breasts feel full before feeding your baby and less full
            after feeding. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your
            child's

            or feeding schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them fussy.
            To help prevent this, burp your baby often. Try burping your baby
            every 2–3 ounces (60–90 milliliters) if you bottle-feed, and each
            time you switch breasts if you breastfeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your baby tends to be gassy, has

              >gastroesophageal reflux</a

            every ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes during
            breastfeeding.
          </p>
          <p>Try these burping tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your shoulder.
              Support your baby's head and back while gently patting the back
              with your other hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sit your baby on your lap. Support your baby's chest and head with
              one hand by cradling your baby's chin in the palm of your hand and
              resting the heel of your hand on your baby's chest (be careful to
              grip your baby's chin — not throat). Use the other hand to gently
              pat your baby's back.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lay your baby face-down on your lap. Support your baby's head,
              making sure it's higher than his or her chest, and gently pat or
              rub his or her back.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your baby doesn't burp after a few minutes, change the baby's
            position and try burping for another few minutes before feeding
            again. Always burp your baby when feeding time is over, then keep
            him or her in an upright position for at least 10–15 minutes to
            avoid spitting up.

            As a new parent, you may be surprised to learn that your newborn,
            who seems to need you every minute of the day, actually
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/sleepnewborn.html">

          <p>
            Newborns typically sleep for periods of 2–4 hours. Don't expect
            yours to sleep through the night — the digestive system of babies is
            so small that they need nourishment every few hours and should be
            awakened if they haven't been fed for 4 hours (or more often if your
            doctor is concerned about weight gain).
          </p>
          <p>
            When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night? Many
            babies sleep through the night (between 6–8 hours) at 3 months of
            age, but if yours doesn't, it's not a cause for concern. Like
            adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns and cycles, so
            if your newborn is gaining weight and appears healthy, don't despair
            if he or she hasn't slept through the night at 3 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to <b class="emphasis"> always</b> place babies on
            their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/sids.html">
              SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)</a
            >. Other safe sleeping practices include: not using blankets,
            quilts, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and pillows in the crib or
            bassinet (these can suffocate a baby); and sharing a bedroom (but
            <b class="emphasis"> not</b> a

            >) with the parents for the first 6 months to 1 year. Also be sure
            to alternate the position of your baby's head from night to night
            (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent the development of a

            Many newborns have their days and nights "mixed up." They tend to be
            more awake and alert at night, and more sleepy during the day. One
            way to help them is to keep stimulation at night to a minimum. Keep
            the lights low, such as by using a nightlight. Reserve talking and
            playing with your baby for the daytime. When your baby wakes up
            during the day, try to keep him or her awake a little longer by
            talking and playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though you may feel anxious about handling a newborn, in a few
            short weeks you'll develop a routine and be parenting like a pro! If
            you have questions or concerns, ask your doctor to recommend
            resources that can help you and your baby grow together.
