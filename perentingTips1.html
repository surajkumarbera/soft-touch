          <p>
            Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they see
            themselves through their parents' eyes. Your tone of voice, your
            body language, and your every expression are absorbed by your kids.
            Your words and actions as a parent affect their developing
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/self-esteem.html">
              self-esteem</a
            >
            more than anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Praising accomplishments, however small, will make them feel proud;
            letting kids do things independently will make them feel capable and
            strong. By contrast, belittling comments or comparing a child
            unfavourably with another will make kids feel worthless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons. Comments
            like "What a stupid thing to do!" or "You act more like a baby than
            your little brother!" cause damage just as physical blows do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose your words carefully and be compassionate. Let your kids know
            that everyone makes mistakes and that you still love them, even when
            you don't love their behaviour.

          <p class="emphasis">2. Catch Kids Being Good</p>
          <p>
            Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react
            negatively to your kids in a given day? You may find yourself
            criticizing far more often than complimenting. How would you feel
            about a boss who treated you with that much negative guidance, even
            if it was well intentioned?
          </p>
          <p>
            The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something right:
            "You made your bed without being asked — that's terrific!" or "I was
            watching you play with your sister and you were very patient." These
            statements will do more to encourage good behaviour over the long
            run than repeated scolding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make a point of finding something to praise every day. Be generous
            with rewards — your love, hugs, and compliments can work wonders and
            are often reward enough. Soon you will find you are "growing" more
            of the behaviour you would like to see.

            3. Set Limits and Be Consistent With Your Discipline
          </p>
          <p>
            Discipline is necessary in every household. The goal of discipline
            is to help kids choose acceptable behaviours and learn self-control.
            They may test the limits you establish for them, but they need those
            limits to grow into responsible adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            Establishing house rules helps kids understand your expectations and
            develop self-control. Some rules might include: no
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tv-habits.html"> TV</a>
            until
            <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/homework.html">
              homework</a
            >
            is done, and no hitting, name-calling, or hurtful teasing allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might want to have a system in place: one warning, followed by
            consequences such as a "time out" or loss of privileges. A common
            mistake parents make is failure to follow through with the
            consequences. You can't discipline kids for talking back one day and
            ignore it the next. Being consistent teaches what you expect.

          <p class="emphasis">4. Make Time for Your Kids</p>
          <p>
            It's often difficult for parents and kids to get together for a
            family meal, let alone spend quality time together. But there is
            probably nothing kids would like more. Get up 10 minutes earlier in
            the morning so you can eat breakfast with your child or leave the
            dishes in the sink and take a walk after dinner. Kids who aren't
            getting the attention they want from their parents often act out or
            misbehave because they're sure to be noticed that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many parents find it rewarding to schedule together time with their
            kids. Create a "special night" each week to be together and let your
            kids help decide how to spend the time. Look for other ways to
            connect — put a note or something special in your kid's lunchbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adolescents seem to need less undivided attention from their parents
            than younger kids. Because there are fewer windows of opportunity
            for parents and teens to get together, parents should do their best
            to be available when their teen does express a desire to talk or
            participate in family activities. Attending concerts, games, and
            other events with your teen communicates caring and lets you get to
            know more about your child and his or her friends in important ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't feel guilty if you're a working parent. It is the many little
            things you do — making popcorn, playing cards, window shopping —
            that kids will remember.

          <p class="emphasis">5. Be a Good Role Model</p>
          <p>
            Young kids learn a lot about how to act by watching their parents.
            The younger they are, the more cues they take from you. Before you
            lash out or blow your top in front of your child, think about this:
            Is that how you want your child to behave when angry? Be aware that
            you're constantly being watched by your kids. Studies have shown
            that children who hit usually have a role model for aggression at
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Model the traits you wish to see in your kids: respect,
            friendliness, honesty, kindness, tolerance. Exhibit unselfish
            behaviour. Do things for other people without expecting a reward.
            Express thanks and offer compliments. Above all, treat your kids the
            way you expect other people to treat you.

      </div>
      <div class="qna">

          <p class="emphasis">6. Make Communication a Priority</p>
          <p>
            You can't expect kids to do everything simply because you, as a
            parent, "say so." They want and deserve explanations as much as
            adults do. If we don't take time to explain, kids will begin to
            wonder about our values and motives and whether they have any basis.
            Parents who reason with their kids allow them to understand and
            learn in a non-judgmental way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make your expectations clear. If there is a problem, describe it,
            express your feelings, and invite your child to work on a solution
            with you. Be sure to include consequences. Make suggestions and
            offer choices. Be open to your child's suggestions as well.
            Negotiate. Kids who participate in decisions are more motivated to
            carry them out.

            7. Be Flexible and Willing to Adjust Your Parenting Style
          </p>
          <p>
            If you often feel "let down" by your child's behaviour, perhaps you
            have unrealistic expectations. Parents who think in "should" (for
            example, "My kid should be potty-trained by now") might find it
            helpful to read up on the matter or to talk to other parents or
            child development specialists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kids' environments have an effect on their behaviour, so you might
            be able to change that behaviour by changing the environment. If you
            find yourself constantly saying "no" to your 2-year-old, look for
            ways to alter your surroundings so that fewer things are off-limits.
            This will cause less frustration for both of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            As your child changes, you'll gradually have to change your
            parenting style. Chances are, what works with your child now won't
            work as well in a year or two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teens tend to look less to their parents and more to their peers for
            role models. But continue to provide guidance, encouragement, and
            appropriate discipline while allowing your teen to earn more
            independence. And seize every available moment to make a connection!

          <p class="emphasis">8. Show That Your Love Is Unconditional</p>
          <p>
            As a parent, you're responsible for correcting and guiding your
            kids. But how you express your corrective guidance makes all the
            difference in how a child receives it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have to confront your child, avoid blaming, criticizing, or
            fault-finding, which undermine self-esteem and can lead to
            resentment. Instead, strive to nurture and encourage, even when
            disciplining your kids. Make sure they know that although you want
            and expect better next time, your love is there no matter what.

            9. Know Your Own Needs and Limitations as a Parent
          </p>
          <p>
            Face it — you are an imperfect parent. You have strengths and
            weaknesses as a family leader. Recognize your abilities — "I am
            loving and dedicated." Vow to work on your weaknesses — "I need to
            be more consistent with discipline." Try to have realistic
            expectations for yourself, your spouse, and your kids. You don't
            have to have all the answers — be forgiving of yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And try to make parenting a manageable job. Focus on the areas that
            need the most attention rather than trying to address everything all
            at once. Admit it when you're burned out. Take time out from
            parenting to do things that will make you happy as a person (or as a
            couple).
          </p>
          <p>
            Focusing on your needs does not make you selfish. It simply means
            you care about your own well-being, which is another important value
            to model for your children.
