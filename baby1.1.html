            During the second half of this year, your little one becomes a baby
            on the go. After learning that they can get somewhere by rolling
            over, they’ll spend the next few months figuring out how to move
            forward or backward. If you haven’t baby-proofed yet, better get on
            it!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>During this time period, your baby may:</li>
            <li>
              Start to crawl. This can include scooting (propelling around on
              their bottom) or “army crawling” (dragging themselves on their
              tummy by arms and legs), as well as standard crawling on hands and

            The last development stage in baby’s first year is quite a
            transition. They aren’t an

          <ul>
            <li>
              Begin feeding herself. Babies at this developmental stage master
              the “pincer grasp“ -- meaning they can hold small objects such as
              O-shaped cereal between their thumb and forefinger.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cruise, or move around the room on their feet while holding onto
              the furniture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Say one or two words, and "Mama" and "Dada" become specific name
              for parents. The average is about three spoken words by the first
              birthday, but the range on this is enormous.

            <li>Point at objects they want in order to get your attention.</li>
            <li>
              Begin “pretend play” by copying you or using objects correctly,

            </li>
            <li>
              Take their first steps. This usually happens right around one

          <p>Your Baby’s Development: When to Talk to a Pediatrician</p>
        </div>

          <p>
            What should you do if you think your baby is not meeting growth or
            developmental milestones, when they should? First, says Shu, trust
            your instincts. “If you really feel like something’s wrong, then
            talk to your doctor about it because if there is a problem, we want
            to catch it as soon as we can," she says. "Early intervention is
            best, and you know your child better than anyone.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, however, that it is not exactly when your baby sits up by
            themselves or says their first words that is important; it’s that
            they are moving forward in their development. “Don’t look at the
            time as much as the progression, and see that your child is changing
            and growing,” says Shu. “It’s not a race. Nobody’s going to ask on a
            college application when your child first walked or said ‘da-da.’”
