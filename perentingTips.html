            Following are some things you, as a parent, can do to help your baby
            during this time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Talk to your baby. She will find your voice calming.</li>
            <li>
              Answer when your baby makes sounds by repeating the sounds and
              adding words. This will help him learn to use language.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read to your baby. This will help her develop and understand
              language and sounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sing to your baby and play music. This will help your baby develop
              a love for music and will help his brain development.
            </li>
            <li>Praise your baby and give her lots of loving attention.</li>
            <li>
              Spend time cuddling and holding your baby. This will help him feel
              cared for and secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Play with your baby when she’s alert and relaxed. Watch your baby
              closely for signs of being tired or fussy so that she can take a
              break from playing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distract your baby with toys and move him to safe areas when he
              starts moving and touching things that he shouldn’t touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.
              Parenting can be hard work! It is easier to enjoy your new baby
              and be a positive, loving parent when you are feeling good
              yourself.

            When a baby becomes part of your family, it is time to make sure
            that your home is a safe place. Look around your home for things
            that could be dangerous to your baby. As a parent, it is your job to
            ensure that you create a safe home for your baby. It also is
            important that you take the necessary steps to make sure that you
            are mentally and emotionally ready for your new baby. Here are a few
            tips to keep your baby safe:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do not shake your baby―ever! Babies have very weak neck muscles
              that are not yet able to support their heads. If you shake your
              baby, you can damage his brain or even cause his death.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure you always put your baby to sleep on her back to prevent
              sudden infant death syndrome (commonly known as SIDS).
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect your baby and family from secondhand smoke. Do not allow
              anyone to smoke in your home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place your baby in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat while
              he is riding in a car..
            </li>
            <li>
              Prevent your baby from choking by cutting her food into small
              bites. Also, don’t let her play with small toys and other things
              that might be easy for her to swallow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t allow your baby to play with anything that might cover her
              face.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never carry hot liquids or foods near your baby or while holding
              him.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vaccines (shots) are important to protect your child’s health and
              safety. Because children can get serious diseases, it is important
              that your child get the right shots at the right time. Talk with
              your child’s doctor to make sure that your child is up-to-date on
              her vaccinations.

              Breast milk meets all your baby’s needs for about the first 6
              months of life. Between 6 and 12 months of age, your baby will
              learn about new tastes and textures with healthy solid food, but
              breast milk should still be an important source of nutrition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Feed your baby slowly and patiently, encourage your baby to try
              new tastes but without force, and watch closely to see if he’s
              still hungry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your baby, but it can be
              challenging. If you need help, you can call the National
              Breastfeeding Helpline at 800-994-9662 or get help on-line
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep your baby active. She might not be able to run and play like
              the “big kids” just yet, but there’s lots she can do to keep her
              little arms and legs moving throughout the day. Getting down on
              the floor to move helps your baby become strong, learn, and
              explore.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try not to keep your baby in swings, strollers, bouncer seats, and
              exercise saucers for too long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit screen time. For children younger than 18 months of age, the
              American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that it’s best if
              babies do not use any screen media other than video chatting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure your child gets the
              <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html"
              >
                recommended amount of sleep</a
              >
              each night: For infants 4-12 months, 12–16 hours per 24 hours
              (including naps)
