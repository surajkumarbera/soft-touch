            During this first development stage, babies’ bodies and brains are
            learning to live in the outside world. Between birth and three
            months, your baby may start to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Smile. Early on, it will be just to themselves. But within three
              months, they’ll be smiling in response to your smiles and trying
              to get you to smile back at them.
            </li>
            <li>Raise their head and chest when on their tummy.</li>
            <li>
              Track objects with their
              <a href="https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes">
                eyes</a
              >
              and gradually decrease eye crossing.
            </li>
            <li>Open and shut their hands and bring hands to their mouth.</li>
            <li>Grip objects in their hands.</li>
            <li>
              Take swipes at or reach for dangling objects, though they usually
              won’t be able to get them yet.

            During these months, babies are really learning to reach out and
            manipulate the world around them. They’re mastering the use of those
            amazing tools, their hands. And they’re discovering their voices.
            From 4 to 6 months old, your baby will probably:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Roll over from front to back or back to front. Front-to-back
              usually comes first.
            </li>
            <li>Babble, making sounds that can sound like real language.</li>
            <li>Laugh.</li>
            <li>
              Reach out for and grab objects (watch out for your
              <a

              >
                hair</a
              >), and manipulate toys and other objects with their hands.
            </li>
            <li>Sit up with support and have great head control.</li>
