            The world serves as one big classroom for toddlers. "They love to
            master new concepts, so it's the perfect time to lay the foundation
            for future skills like reading and counting," says Erin Seaton,
            Ed.D., a lecturer in the department of education at Tufts University
            in Medford, Massachusetts. The key is to play off

            name, so be sure to display it throughout your home—on her bedroom
            door, a bathroom step stool, the fridge, etc. Point to the letters,
            saying each one out loud, suggests Dr. Seaton. Talk about other
            words that begin with the same letter as her name does ("C is for
            Caitlin, but it's also for cat and cup").

            Point out words and letters on street signs, in stores, and at the
            doctor's office, says Sherril English, an education professor at
            Southern Methodist University, in Dallas. Say them out loud ("That
            sign says stop"), and help your child think of other

            ("Stop sounds like hop, bop, and mop"). To help your toddler connect
            letters to the sounds they make, speak slowly, enunciate clearly,
            and place your finger under the letters and words as you read.

          <p>
            Your 2-year-old may be able to recite the numbers one to ten in
            order, but the ability to truly count probably won't come until

            >, says Dr. Seaton. Still, you can bolster his number recognition by
            tallying up totals as you get him dressed ("One, two, three
            buttons"),

            ("There are six peas on your plate"), and shop for groceries ("I
            have three potatoes, so I need one more to make four"). Use your
            fingers when counting, and encourage him to copy you with his
            fingers.

          <p>
            The act of observing, comparing, and contrasting objects is a vital
            part of early mathematics, says Dr. Seaton. Fortunately, little kids
            are master sorters. In this learning activity for toddlers, ask your
            child to group his stuffed animals by type (cats in one pile, bears
            in another) or by color. See if he can separate your clean socks
            from his

            >, and have him put different-size spoons in their proper place in
            the silverware tray. Sometime before age 2, your child will also
            recognize the difference between less and more. "Ask questions like
            'Which pile has the most and which one the least?'" says Dr. Seaton.

              >teach kids about shapes</a
            >, but you can go one better by helping your toddler make her own
            bound volume. After drawing shapes on a piece of paper, flip through
            magazines and newspapers together and cut out items that match each
            one, suggests English. Then go for a walk to look for other objects
            with distinctive shapes. Snap photos of the things your child points
            out—a square window, a round tire, a rectangular brick. Print out
            and paste the pictures into the book when you get home and label the
            shapes. Put multiple examples on a page to show that shapes come in
            different sizes.

            letting your child trace shapes of cookie cutters onto a piece of
            paper, and then help her identify and label each one, recommends
            English.

            as a fun learning activity for toddlers. Name the colors as he
            spreads each one. Once the masterpiece dries, you can go on a
            scavenger hunt around your home, looking for items that match the
            colors used in the picture. Talk about how there are many shades of
            colors—from pale sky blue to blue that's so dark it looks almost
            black.

          <p>
            Use descriptive language as much as possible to help your child
            recognize different colors ("Can you put this yellow ball into the
            blue bin?"). At mealtime ask, "Do you want more of the red apple or
            the yellow banana?" You can also try designating a day in honor of a
            color, says English. Wear green on Thursday and eat green grapes and
            green beans while drinking green-colored milk (a little food
            coloring will do the trick). Then, at the end of the day, let your
            child unwind in a bath tinted green with fizzy bath tablets.
