            During the second trimester of pregnancy, symptoms that you may have
            experienced during the first trimester begin to improve. Many women
            report that nausea and fatigue begin to lessen and they consider the
            second trimester the easiest and most enjoyable part of their
            pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p>The following changes and symptoms may occur:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the uterus expands</li>
            <li>you begin to show a larger abdomen</li>
            <li>dizziness or light-headedness due to lower blood pressure</li>
            <li>feeling the baby move</li>
            <li>body aches</li>
            <li>increased appetite</li>
            <li>stretch marks on the stomach, breast, thighs, or buttocks</li>
            <li>
              skin changes, like darkening of the skin around your nipples, or
              patches of darker skin

            The baby’s organs become fully developed during the second
            trimester. The baby can also start to hear and swallow. Small hairs
            become noticeable. Later on in the second trimester, the baby will
            begin to move around. It will develop sleeping and waking cycles
            that a pregnant woman will begin to notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the

            >, by the end of the second trimester the baby will be around 14
            inches in length and weigh a little over two pounds.

            Women should see a doctor about every two to four weeks during the
            second trimester of pregnancy. Tests that the doctor may perform
            during a visit include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>measuring your blood pressure</li>
            <li>checking your weight</li>

          <p>
            During the second trimester, your doctor can use an ultrasound test
            to determine whether or not your baby is a boy or a girl. Deciding
            whether or not you want to know the sex of the baby before you give
            birth is your own choice.

            Although there are still several weeks left in the pregnancy, you
            may want to plan for delivery earlier to help make the third
            trimester less stressful. Here are some things you can do now to
            prepare for birth:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take prenatal education classes that are offered locally.</li>
            <li>
              Consider classes on breastfeeding, infant CPR, first aid, and
              parenting.
            </li>
            <li>Educate yourself with online research.</li>
            <li>
              Watch birth videos on YouTube that are natural and not
              frightening.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tour the hospital or birth center where you will be giving birth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a nursery or space in your house or apartment for the newborn
              baby.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Consider whether or not you want to take medication for the pain
            during delivery.
