            In the third trimester a woman may experience more aches, pain, and
            swelling as she carries around her baby. A pregnant woman may also

            Your doctor will check you progress with a vaginal exam. Your cervix

            It’s important to be aware of what to do and what to avoid as your
            pregnancy continues in order to take care of yourself and your
            developing baby.
          </p>
          <ul>

            <li>Stay active unless you’re experiencing swelling or pain.</li>
            <li>Work out your pelvic floor by doing Kegel exercises.</li>
            <li>
              Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, low-fat forms of protein,

            <li>
              long car trips and airplane flights, if possible (after 34 weeks,

              possibility of an unexpected delivery on the plane)
            </li>

            If you haven’t done this already, make a decision on where you plan
            to give birth to your child. These last-minute preparations can help
            make delivery go more smoothly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Attend a prenatal class if you haven’t already. This is an
              opportunity to learn about what to expect during labor and the
              different options available for delivery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find a family member or friend who can care for your pets or other
              children.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook some meals that can be frozen and eaten after you get home
              with the baby.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have an overnight bag packed and ready with items for you and your

            </li>
            <li>
              Plan the route and mode of transportation for getting to the
              hospital.
            </li>
            <li>Have a car seat set up in your vehicle.</li>
            <li>
              Develop a birth plan with your doctor. This may include deciding
              who you want in your labor room for support, concerns you have
              about hospital procedures, and pre-registering with your insurance
              information.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange maternity leave with your employer.</li>
            <li>
              Have a crib ready for your baby and double-check that it’s up to

              strollers, make sure they conform to current government safety
              standards. Purchase a new car seat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check that your smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in
              your home are working properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have emergency numbers, including poison control, written
              somewhere close to your phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stock up on baby supplies, like diapers, wipes, and baby clothing
