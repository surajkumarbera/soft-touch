          <p>Average baby weight and length chart by month</p>

          <p>
            In the United States, the average baby weighs about 7 pounds 3
            ounces (3.3 kg) at birth. Girls (at 7 pounds, 1 ounce/3.2 kg) are a
            bit smaller than boys (at 7 pounds 4 ounces/3.3 kg) on arrival. The
            average new-born is 19 1/2 inches (49.5 cm) long, with girls
            measuring 19 inches (49 cm) and boys measuring 19 3/4 inches (50
            cm).
          </p>
          <p>
            While most babies (both formula and breastfed) lose weight during
            the first few days of life, within a couple of weeks they're back to
            their birth weight. Until 3 months of age, most babies gain about an
            ounce each day. By age 4 months, most infants have doubled their
            birth weight, and by 1 year, most have tripled it. Most babies also
            grow about 10 inches (25 cm) by their first birthday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that babies and children have growth spurts, too –
            which means that growth isn't always a gradual, predictable process.
            Just when you start to wonder whether your child has grown enough
            lately, he may climb the charts!
          </p>
          <p>
            The data in the charts below comes from the World Health
            Organization for children younger than 2, and the U.S. Centres for
            Disease Control and Prevention for children age 2 and older.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="emphasis">Quick tip:</b> For babies born prematurely, use
            gestational age (not age since birth) when you look up their numbers
            in this chart. You can also find growth charts specifically for
            preterm infants here. If you have a special-needs child, your doctor
            may give you a different chart.

            Between 12 and 24 months, most toddlers grow about 4 or 5 inches (10
            to 12 cm) and gain about 5 pounds (2.27 kg). Your little one will
            start looking more like a child than a baby as he starts to slim
            down a bit and become more muscular.

          <p>What factors can affect my child's weight and height?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answers">
          <p>
            Your child's genes are the biggest factor determining how tall he'll
            get and how heavy he'll be. But there are other factors, too:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Gestation:</b> If your baby arrived after her due date, she may
              be larger than average, and if she was born prematurely, she'll
              probably be smaller. (Because multiples are typically born early,
              they tend to be smaller, too.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Your pregnancy health:</b> If you smoked or ate poorly during
              pregnancy, you're more likely to give birth to a smaller baby. If
              you gained a great deal of weight during pregnancy or had
              gestational diabetes , you're more likely to give birth to a
              larger baby.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Gender:</b> Baby girls are typically a little smaller (length
              and weight) at birth than baby boys.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Breastfed or formula fed:</b> In their first year, breastfed
              infants will gain weight more slowly than formula-fed infants, who
              will gain weight more rapidly after about 3 months of age. (For
              the first few months, the breastfed babies grow more quickly.) By
              age 2, breastfed and formula-fed babies weigh about the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hormones:</b> If your child has a hormone imbalance, such as
              low growth hormone levels or a low thyroid level, it could slow
              his growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Medications:</b> Certain medications, such as regular use of
              corticosteroids, might slow growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Health issues:</b> If your child has a chronic illness (such as
              cancer, kidney disease, or cystic fibrosis), or any disorder
              affecting his ability to eat or absorb nutrients (such as
              gastrointestinal problems), his growth might be slowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Genetic conditions:</b> Beyond your child's general genetic
              makeup (you and his dad are tall, for example), having certain
              genetic conditions – such as Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or
              Turner syndrome – could affect his growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sleep:</b> Babies grow after sleeping, so if your baby's a good
              sleeper, he may also be a good grower!
            </li>

            Growth charts give you a general idea of how your child is growing.
            They use percentiles to compare your baby's growth to other babies
            of the same age and sex.

            The charts below show the height and weight (or length, for babies)
            for children of both genders in the 50th percentile, which is the
            average. Anything higher means your child is larger than average.
            Anything lower means he is smaller than average.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if your 2-month-old daughter weighs 13 pounds, she is
            heavier than average. If she is 20 inches long, she is smaller than
            average.

            Your doctor will normally calculate your child's weight and height
            as a percentile. If your child is in the 75th percentile for weight,
            for example, that means 74 percent of children her age and gender
            weigh less, and 24 percent weigh more.
