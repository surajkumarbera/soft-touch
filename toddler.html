          <ul>
            <li>
              To stay clean, toddlers need a bath only 2-3 times a week. But
              they often enjoy baths more often than this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clean toddlers’ faces and genitals daily even if they don’t bath
              every day.
            </li>
            <li>Never leave toddlers alone in the bath.</li>
            <li>
              Some toddlers are afraid of baths. Try bathing with them or making
              baths a time for play.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="emphasis">Dental Care:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For most children, all 20 baby teeth arrive by three years of age.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prevent tooth decay by brushing teeth twice a day and avoiding
              sugary foods and drinks.
            </li>
            <li>Use low-fluoride toothpaste from 18 months of age.</li>
            <li>
              Take your child to see the dentist at around 12 months of age or
              when the first tooth appears.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p class="emphasis">Dressing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Getting dressed is an important skill for children to learn – but
              it can be hard.
            </li>
            <li>
              It helps to break getting dressed into small steps. Teaching the
              last step first can work well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep in mind that every child is different and will develop skills
              at different rates.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="emphasis">Health Care:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Common child health issues include allergies, colds,
              conjunctivitis, gastro, hand, foot and mouth disease, impetigo,
              lice and worms.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can treat mild health issues at home. But if you’re worried,
              see your GP.
            </li>
            <li>
              Handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of
              infection.

          <p class="emphasis">Anxiety and Fear in children :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Anxiety in children is normal. Childhood anxieties and fears
              include separation anxiety, fear of the dark and worries about
              school.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acknowledge your child’s anxiety and encourage him to do the
              things he’s anxious about. Praise him when he does.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seek professional help if you think anxiety is affecting your
              child’s health and happiness.
